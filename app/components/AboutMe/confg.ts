  "Hello, thank you for checking my portfolio out. I hope you've been enjoying it (and fingers crossed impressed by it). Please let me briefly introduce myself and give you a little professional background summary. I am Berat, a former Web / Graphic Designer transitioned into a Fullstack Developer.",
  "Throughout my software engineering career, I've been involved in various productions, ranging from immersive web experiences to mobile applications, where I've developed complex styled applications with intricate underlying logic using Scrum Methodologies. TypeScript has been the primary programming language in these applications.",
  "I have used many popular modern libraries, frameworks and tools such as Next.js, React & React Native ecosystem, Redux, Graphql, styled-components, Tailwindcss, Node.js, Nest.js, Terraform, AWS Cloud, GCP and many more...",
  "I've started my career as a Frontend Developer and as user interface development became natural, I sought to explore more challenging and unfamiliar realms of software development. This led me to delve into Backend and DevOps technologies to understand how applications handle data and are deployed to end-users.",
  "And with that I transitioned to a more cloud focused FullStack position wehere I had the chance write API's, deploy and provision infrastructure and have the exposure to the other side of the coin.",
  "I am always out searching for new challenges and I always accept them as opportunities to grow. My interest in learning new things drives me to constantly push boundaries and tackle new challenges, which I believe is fundamental in our field.",
