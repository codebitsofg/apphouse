  "Thanks for viewing this page. I am a frontend developer with 2 years of experience primarily in Next.js, WebGL, Typescript, and React Native. Working with prominent clients, I've implemented Scrum methodologies in their projects and executed designs into code for advertisment purposes. My passion for learning drives me to constantly push boundaries and tackle new challenges, which I believe is fundamental in our field.",
  "In my previous role, I've been involved in various projects, ranging from immersive web experiences to mobile applicationss, where I've developed complex styled applications with intricate underlying logic. TypeScript has been the primary programming language in these productions.",
  "I have used modern tooling in React & React Native ecosystem which includes many popular libraries and frameworks as Next.js, Redux, Graphql, styled-components, Tailwindcss, Howler, Zustand, GSAP and many more",
  "As user interface development became naturel and familiar to me, I sought to explore more challenging and unfamiliar realms of software development. This led me to delve into Backend and DevOps technologies to understand how applications handle data and are deployed to end-users.",
  "During this phase, I acquired skills in writing CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and exploring the intricacies of server-side development. These experiences have been incredibly rewarding, and I'm enthusiastic about delving deeper into backend development.",
  "Recently, I relocated to Poland from Turkey. Now that I'm in a new country, I'm eager to seize the opportunity to explore different workplaces, meet new people, and embrace new approaches to development. I am open to remote work arrangements and am capable of working business-to-business.",
